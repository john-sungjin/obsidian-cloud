# Obsidian Cloud

Motivation: I wanted to make Obsidian to work more in line with how I think. Some (poorly explained) principles:

- Canvas-centric: I enjoy thinking on a canvas; it's easier to work on multiple threads, if necessary, is useful for brainstorming, etc. Canvases are like working memory; I want to make a canvas for each day, each project, each idea, etc.
- Daily canvas: I want to feel free to "mess up" a canvas/documents each day because I think well when typing my thoughts out. A daily journal helps, but a daily canvas is even better.
- Pinning: With the plain daily journal, it's annoying that everything is removed the next day and I have to go find the information I need. Pinning allows me to keep information I need from one day and copy it to the next daily canvas.
- Spontaneity: I want to be reminded of notes I've jotted in the past, almost like spaced repetition to help me learn. I also want, as I write, to see similar notes I've written, maybe have them bubble into my canvas.

## Features
- Daily canvas + Pinning
- TODO: easier "convert to file" - converting a card to a file takes too many steps. I want it to just take the first line as the title - just like Apple Notes.
- TODO: similar notes. See similar notes as I write.
- TODO: spaced repetition. Start each new canvas with a random note from the past.
